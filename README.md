## Introduction

This project demonstrates the automation of deploying a microservice application onto an AWS EKS cluster using a CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline automates building, testing, and deploying the application, ensuring quick and reliable updates.

## Architecture

The architecture of this project includes the following components:

- **Microservice Application**: A sample microservice application written in [your programming language].
- **Docker**: Containerizes the microservice application.
- **AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**: Hosts the containerized application.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automates the build, test, and deploy process using Jenkins.
